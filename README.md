# FH4-Mixer-Influence-Automation
This script will avoid influence farm channels (these channels are nerfed and do not give influence in-game) and automatically select channels that are currently streaming.


# Usage
 The first time a user uses the script they will be prompted to login, after logging in they should press enter in the python shell.
 This script will save the session cookies to a file and load them on startup. This prevents the user from having to login every time they start the script.

# Requirements
Please install the packages listed in requirements.txt
Additionally, you'll need to have the ChromeDriver (https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) accessible via PATH (system variable).
